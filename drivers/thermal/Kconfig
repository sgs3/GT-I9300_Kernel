menuconfig THERMAL
	tristate "Generic Thermal sysfs driver"
	help
	  Generic Thermal Sysfs driver offers a generic mechanism for
	  thermal management. Usually it's made up of one or more thermal
	  zone and cooling device.
	  Each thermal zone contains its own temperature, trip points,
	  cooling devices.
	  All platforms with ACPI thermal support can use this driver.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y or M here.

config THERMAL_HWMON
	bool "Hardware monitoring support"
	depends on THERMAL
	depends on HWMON=y || HWMON=THERMAL
	help
	  The generic thermal sysfs driver's hardware monitoring support
	  requires a 2.10.7/3.0.2 or later lm-sensors userspace.

	  Say Y if your user-space is new enough.

config CPU_THERMAL
	bool "generic cpu cooling support"
	depends on THERMAL
	help
	  This implements the generic cpu cooling mechanism through frequency
	  reduction, cpu hotplug and any other ways of reducing temperature. An
	  ACPI version of this already exists(drivers/acpi/processor_thermal.c).
	  This will be useful for platforms using the generic thermal interface
	  and not the ACPI interface.
	  If you want this support, you should say Y or M here.

config SAMSUNG_THERMAL_INTERFACE
	bool "Samsung Thermal interface support"
	depends on THERMAL && CPU_THERMAL
	help
	  This is a samsung thermal interface which will be used as
	  a link between sensors and cooling devices with linux thermal
	  framework.

config SENSORS_EXYNOS4_TMU
	tristate "Temperature sensor on Samsung EXYNOS4"
	depends on ARCH_EXYNOS4
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for TMU (Thermal Managment
	  Unit) on SAMSUNG EXYNOS4 series of SoC.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called exynos4-tmu.
