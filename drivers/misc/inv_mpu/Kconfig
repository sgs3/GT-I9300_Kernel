      If you say yes here you get access to the timerirq device handle which
      can be used to select on.  This can be used instead of IRQ's, sleeping,
      or timer threads.  Reading from this device returns the same type of
      information as reading from the MPU and slave IRQ's.

config MPU_SENSORS_DEBUG

    help
      If you say yes here you get extra debug messages from the MPU6050
      and other slave sensors.
